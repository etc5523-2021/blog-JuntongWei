No matter in the number of total vaccinations, people get vaccinated or people get completely vaccinated, we can all easily find the vaccination is being phased in.\nNumerical summary in age group\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nage_group\n\n\ncount_people_vaccinated\n\n\ncount_fully_vaccinated\n\n\n1\n\n\n18-24\n\n\n19.88594\n\n\n8.205938\n\n\n2\n\n\n25-49\n\n\n23.82656\n\n\n11.450313\n\n\n3\n\n\n50-59\n\n\n36.14937\n\n\n19.139063\n\n\n4\n\n\n60-69\n\n\n43.43031\n\n\n24.479688\n\n\n5\n\n\n70-79\n\n\n57.26656\n\n\n39.455937\n\n\n6\n\n\n80+\n\n\n56.57844\n\n\n42.164375\n\n\nThe above table illustrate the popularizing rate of vaccination in each age group.
