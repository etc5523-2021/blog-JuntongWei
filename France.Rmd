## Introduction

Have you ever heard of the lyrics: "Imagine there's no countries. It isn't hard to do." from Imagine by John Lennon. It was not that difficult to imagine under the globalization before everything since 2019. However, the world has changed since then. The Coronavirus is familiarly enouth to you all as it has affect all humankind since its outbreak. Due to the Pandemic, the borders had shut down on after another, the cities were also locked down.  What’s more, the living styles had also changed a lot. Since it has been affecting us for a long period of time and it is still existing, it is necessary for us get to know more about it and fight against the disaster together to restore the order of the world. This report gievs an analysis about **covid-19** in **france**.

## Data descreption

This blog has used two main data sets as the base for the construction of COVID-19 vaccinations in different group. Both of them were downloaded from github and we can freely use it. First dataset is about the overall vaccination situation in France, which we used is 5 column and `r nrow(France)`rows. And second dataset use `r ncol(age_vaccinations)` columns and `r nrow(age_vaccinations)` rows. 

```{r laod data}

library(ggplot2)

France <- read_csv("Data/France.csv") %>% 
  select(date| total_vaccinations| people_vaccinated| people_fully_vaccinated|vaccine)

age_vaccinations <- read_csv("Data/vaccinations-by-age-group.csv") %>% 
  group_by(location) %>% 
  subset(location == "France")
```

### Numerical statistical summary in France data

```{r}
France %>% 
  select(-date) %>% 
  describe() -> vac_des

vac_des %>% 
    mutate(mean = round(mean,2),
         sd = round(sd, 2),
         median = round(median,2),
         trimmed = round(trimmed,2),
         mad = round(mad,2),
         min = round(min,2),
         max = round(max,2),
         range = round(range,2),
         skew = round(skew,2),
         kurtosis = round(kurtosis,2),
         se = round(se,2)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Statistics summary of vaccination data", 
      align = "l", ) %>% 
  row_spec(0, color = "white", background = "#008000") %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "150px") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10)

```

## Data Exploratory

### Monthly vaccinations status overview in France

```{r tab1}
France %>% 
  mutate(month = month(France$date)) %>% 
  select(total_vaccinations | people_vaccinated | people_fully_vaccinated | month) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(average_total_vaccin = round(mean(total_vaccinations, na.rm = TRUE)), 
            average_people_vaccin = round(mean(people_vaccinated, na.rm = TRUE)), 
            average_people_fully_vaccin = round(mean(people_fully_vaccinated, na.rm = TRUE))) ->aaa

DT::datatable(aaa, options = list(pageLength = 6), 
              caption = "Monthly vaccinations status, start from 2020-12-27 to 2021-8-30")
```

From the above table, we can easy find from December 2020 to August 2021 in France, vaccinations are getting better every month. No matter in the number of total vaccinations, people get vaccinated or people get completely vaccinated, we can all easily find the vaccination is being phased in.

#### Numerical summary in age group

```{r }
age_vaccinations %>% 
  group_by(age_group) %>% 
  summarise(count_people_vaccinated = mean(people_vaccinated_per_hundred), 
          count_fully_vaccinated = mean(people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred)) -> data2

data2 %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("Variables") %>%
  formattable(list(area(col = 3:4) ~ color_tile("#F5B7B1", "#7DCEA0")))
```

The above table illustrate the popularizing rate of vaccination in each age group. The fill color more pink, which means the popularizing rate is low, and if the color more green, the popularizing rate is higher. From that table, we can find the vaccination priorities are based on age, with older people getting vaccinated first. 

### The timeline of vaccination

```{r fig, fig.align='center', fig.cap="The rate of vaccine coverage speed in France from Jan 2021 to Aug 2021"}
age_vaccinations %>%
  select(date | age_group | people_vaccinated_per_hundred) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, 
             y = people_vaccinated_per_hundred, 
             color = age_group, 
             text = age_group)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  ggtitle("Rate of vaccine coverage in France by each age group") +
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(legend.position="right") +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("People vaccinated per hundred") -> plot1

plot1 <- ggplotly(plot1, tooltip="text")
plot1
```
According to the above figure, the trend overall is increase, and it's rapidly increase between March to May. What's more, before May, the Vaccination coverage rates of 80+ age group is number one, and after may, it is surpassed by 70-79 age group. Further more, for younger people, age between 49 to 18, it increase slowly until May, and grow rapidly until now.
